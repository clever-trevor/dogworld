Playing around with Android app, Flutter and Rive with my son's toy dogs!

Open in Android Studio to build.  

Shows a couple of toy dog animations and plays a barking sound

Anims available on Rive (or at least they were until Rive decided to release a new platform and didn't let anyone know so now they are history!)

Old flare.rive.app is no longer available so animations imported to new site.
